        <h1>Facebook</h1>
        <p>Facebook, Inc. is an American online social media and social networking service company. It is based in Menlo
            Park,
            California. It was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates
            Eduardo
            Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. It is considered one of the Big Four technology
            companies along with Amazon, Apple, and Google.[8][9]
        </p>
        <p>The founders initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students and subsequently Columbia,
            Stanford,
            and Yale students. Membership was eventually expanded to the remaining Ivy League schools, MIT, and higher
            education
            institutions in the Boston area. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other
            universities, and eventually to high school students. Since 2006, anyone who claims to be at least 13 years
            old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in this requirement,
            depending on local laws.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students.
            </li>
            <li>Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 billion,
                the largest
                valuation to date for a newly listed public company.</li>
            <li>It began selling stock to the public three months later. Facebook makes most of its revenue from
                advertisements that appear onscreen.
