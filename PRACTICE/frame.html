					In November 2017, Karunya was ordered to close two off-campus centres in Periyanaickenpalayam, which was opened without 
					permission. In addition, a letter from the UGC showed that Karunya has not renewed its deemed-to-be-university status,
					 which as expired in 2007.[7] The institute has agreed to close the centres, leaving 750 students to find other solutions, s
					 ince the courses they were pursuing, management, science and social science courses, are not offered at Karunya's main campus
					 . The UGC had also formed a committee of experts to inspect the institution.[8] Acting on the recommendations of said committee,
					 in June 2018 an extension to the deemed-to-be-university status was granted for a period of five years.
